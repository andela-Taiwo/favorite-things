For performance monitoring, there are lots of tools for monitoring, for example, LocustIo, Prometheus with Graphana. However, for the project, I will chooss LocustIO.
LocustIO, an open source tool written in python, is used for load testing of web applications. It is simple and easy to use with web UI to view the test results. It is scalable and can be distributed over multiple machines.
